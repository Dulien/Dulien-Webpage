# Dulien Webpage
To aquire web development skills and learn the basic languages revolving the practice, I created this website from scratch.
This page will have 2 uses. It will act as a portfolio where I can upload all my projects for everyone to download and use.
And it will act as a testing space for me to improve and experiment with my new skillset. While working on this project,
I also aquired knowledge on how to put a webpage online. By reserving a DNS, finding a host, and uploading the files through
an FTP server.
