            <h1>Handwritten Digits OCR</h1>
            <p>
                Using Tensorflow and Keras libraries, I created a basic neural network that could 
                correctly identify any handwritten digits (from 0 - 9). The model uses the MNIST 
                handwrittem digits database to train itself. The dataset consists of 60,000 training 
                images and 10,000 testing images. The images are in a gray-scale value and they each 
                have a dimension of 28x28 pixels. Alongside my friend Stefano Stella, we created a 
                basic user interface for this program using PyQt5. <br>

            <p>
                To aquire web development skills and learn the basic languages revolving the practice,
                I created this website from scratch. This page will have 2 uses. It will act as a portfolio 
                where I can upload all my projects for everyone to download and use. And it will act as a
                testing space for me to improve and experiment with my new skillset. While working on this project,
                I also aquired knowledge on how to put a webpage online. By reserving a DNS, finding a host, and uploading
                the files through an FTP server. <br>
